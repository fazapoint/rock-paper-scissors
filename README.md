# rock-paper-scissors
Rock paper scissors game in javascript for the odin project submission!
You can see the live preview [here](https://fazapoint.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)

What i did in this project:
- pick a random element from an array
- using addEventListener() and use logic for every button clicked
- using querrySelectorAll() for buttons and use them as an array-like using forEach()
- button display manipulation for displaying button or make them hidden
- dom manipulation for game information that being played
